# yaap-edna
Setting up YAAP on Myriad following [ilevantis/YAAP](https://github.com/ilevantis/YAAP)

## install.sh
This file lists the commands used to set up the conda environment. You may find it easier to run each line manually rather than execute the script itself. This should only need to be done once. It is assumed that your personal `~/bin` folder is in your `PATH`, so that things installed can be run from anywhere. If this is not the case simply add `export PATH=${PATH}:~/bin` to the end of your `.bashrc` file.
